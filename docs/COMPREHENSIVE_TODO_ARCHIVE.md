## Implementation Notes

- **No Toast Notifications**: All toast notification systems have been removed from the design
- **Two States Only**: Application operates exclusively in maximized avatar mode or minimized tray mode
- **No Admin Permissions**: All functionality must work with standard user permissions
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear separation between presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure layers
- **Type Safety**: Use Python type hints throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Target < 3 second startup time and < 150MB executable size
