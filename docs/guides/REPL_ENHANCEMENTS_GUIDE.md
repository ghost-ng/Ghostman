# REPL Interface Enhancements Guide

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive enhancements made to the Ghostman REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) interface, implementing advanced multiline support, enhanced markdown rendering, and improved user interaction capabilities.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Shift+Enter Multiline Support

**Feature**: Users can now create multiline inputs using Shift+Enter, with the input field dynamically expanding upward to accommodate content.

**Implementation Details**:
- Replaced `QLineEdit` with `QPlainTextEdit` for native multiline support
- Custom event filtering distinguishes between Enter (submit) and Shift+Enter (newline)
- Dynamic height calculation system with visual line counting for text wrapping
- Smooth animations for height transitions (150ms cubic easing)

**Key Code Components**:
```python
# Event handling in _eventFilter method
if key_event.key() == Qt.Key.Key_Return or key_event.key() == Qt.Key.Key_Enter:
    if key_event.modifiers() == Qt.KeyboardModifier.ShiftModifier:
        # Shift+Enter: Insert newline and trigger height update
        cursor = self.command_input.textCursor()
        cursor.insertText('\n')
        # Trigger height update after newline is inserted
        QTimer.singleShot(10, self._on_input_text_changed)
        return True
```

**Technical Architecture**:
- `_init_dynamic_input_height()`: Initializes height management system
- `_calculate_visual_lines()`: Counts both manual breaks and wrapped text
- `_update_input_height()`: Applies height changes with 32px baseline alignment
- `_on_input_text_changed()`: Triggers recalculation on content changes

### 2. Enhanced Markdown Rendering

**Feature**: Migrated from Python-Markdown to mistune v3 for significantly improved performance and better AI content handling.

**Implementation Details**:
- mistune v3 provides 2-3x better performance than Python-Markdown
- Enhanced plugin support for tables, strikethrough, highlights, and insertions
- Better handling of AI-generated content with complex formatting
- Graceful fallback to plain text when markdown is unavailable

**Key Improvements**:
```python
# mistune v3 configuration with AI-friendly plugins
self.md_processor = mistune.create_markdown(
    renderer='html',
    plugins=[
        'table',        # Table support
        'strikethrough', # ~~strikethrough~~ support
        'mark',         # ==highlight== support
        'insert',       # ++insert++ support
    ],
    hard_wrap=True,  # Convert single newlines to <br>
)
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- Faster rendering of long conversations
- Reduced memory usage during markdown processing
- Better handling of edge cases in AI-generated content

### 3. Stop Button Functionality

**Feature**: Added ability to cancel active AI queries with proper thread management and UI state synchronization.

**Implementation Details**:
- Stop button appears during AI processing, replacing send button
- Proper thread cancellation without memory leaks
- Clean UI state restoration after cancellation
- Visual feedback with danger-state styling

**Technical Components**:
```python
def _on_stop_query(self):
    """Handle stop button click to cancel active AI query."""
    if self.current_ai_worker:
        self.current_ai_worker.stop_requested = True
    
    if self.current_ai_thread and self.current_ai_thread.isRunning():
        self.current_ai_thread.quit()
        self.current_ai_thread.wait(5000)  # 5 second timeout
```

**UI State Management**:
- Button visibility toggling during processing states
- Consistent styling with theme system integration
- Proper alignment with input field baseline

### 4. Dynamic Input Field Behavior

**Feature**: Input field expands intelligently based on both manual line breaks (Shift+Enter) and automatic text wrapping.

**Technical Details**:
- Visual line counting algorithm handles wrapped text accurately
- Minimum/maximum line constraints (1-5 lines) for usability
- Font metrics-based height calculations for precise alignment
- Real-time height updates during typing and window resizing

**Height Calculation Algorithm**:
```python
def _calculate_visual_lines(self):
    """Calculate total visual lines including wrapped text."""
    if not hasattr(self, 'command_input') or not self.command_input:
        return 1
    
    document = self.command_input.document()
    total_lines = 0
    
    for i in range(document.blockCount()):
        block = document.findBlockByNumber(i)
        layout = block.layout()
        
        if layout and layout.lineCount() > 0:
            total_lines += layout.lineCount()
        else:
            total_lines += 1  # Empty blocks count as 1 line
    
    return max(1, total_lines)
```

### 5. Perfect UI Alignment

**Feature**: Fixed height and alignment issues between input field, prompt label, and buttons for a polished interface.

**Implementation**:
- 32px baseline height matching button dimensions
- Proper vertical alignment using `Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignBottom`
- Consistent margins and padding across all UI elements
- Theme-aware styling that adapts to different visual themes

## Architecture Decisions

### Input Widget Migration
- **From**: `QLineEdit` (single-line only)
- **To**: `QPlainTextEdit` (native multiline support)
- **Rationale**: Enables Shift+Enter functionality without complex workarounds

### Markdown Library Migration
- **From**: Python-Markdown with extensions
- **To**: mistune v3 with built-in plugins
- **Rationale**: 2-3x performance improvement, better AI content handling, smaller dependency footprint

### Thread Management
- **Approach**: Cooperative cancellation with timeout fallback
- **Safety**: Prevents memory leaks and zombie threads
- **User Experience**: Immediate UI feedback with proper state restoration

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

**Multiline Input**:
1. Type your message in the input field
2. Press Shift+Enter to create a new line
3. Continue typing across multiple lines
4. Press Enter (without Shift) to send the complete message

**Stopping AI Queries**:
1. While AI is processing (spinner visible), click the red "Stop" button
2. The query will be cancelled and the interface will return to normal state
3. You can immediately start a new query

**Dynamic Text Field**:
- The input field automatically expands as you type long messages
- It also expands when you add manual line breaks with Shift+Enter
- Maximum height is limited to 5 lines for optimal usability

### For Developers

**Extending the System**:
- Height calculation system can be modified via `max_input_lines` and `min_input_lines`
- Custom event filters can be added to the existing `_eventFilter` method
- Markdown rendering can be extended by modifying the mistune plugin configuration

**Theme Integration**:
- All new UI elements use the unified theme system via `ButtonStyleManager`
- Custom styling should use the established theme color variables
- Dynamic styling updates are handled automatically via theme change signals
