# File Upload Context Fix - Immediate File Access ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified

**User reported:** "the app wouldn't use my uploaded files for context until AFTER I sent another message, then the subsequent message would use the context."

### Root Cause

**Timing/Lifecycle Issue:**
1. User uploads file ‚Üí File gets processed and added to FAISS
2. User sends message immediately
3. **Problem:** The current RAG session was created BEFORE the file was uploaded
4. RAG session has the "old" empty FAISS state cached in memory
5. Next message creates a NEW RAG session ‚Üí sees the file ‚Üí works!

**This is a session caching problem.** The RAG session doesn't know that new files have been added to FAISS.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

**File:** `ghostman/src/presentation/widgets/repl_widget.py`

#### 1. Added Signal Connection ([line 3139](ghostman/src/presentation/widgets/repl_widget.py#L3139))

Connected the `processing_completed` signal from file browser to a new handler:

```python
self.file_browser_bar.file_removed.connect(self._on_file_removed_safe)
self.file_browser_bar.processing_completed.connect(self._on_file_processing_completed)  # NEW!
self.file_browser_bar.clear_all_requested.connect(self._on_clear_all_files_safe)
```

#### 2. Added Handler Method ([line 3241](ghostman/src/presentation/widgets/repl_widget.py#L3241))

Created `_on_file_processing_completed()` method that:
- Listens for file processing completion
- Refreshes RAG session stats when files are successfully processed
- Ensures next query sees the newly added file

```python
def _on_file_processing_completed(self, file_id, status):
    """Handle file processing completion - refresh RAG session to include new file."""
    try:
        logger.info(f"üìÅ File processing completed: {file_id[:8]} - {status}")

        if status == "completed":
            # File was successfully processed and added to FAISS
            # Refresh the RAG session so next query sees the new file
            logger.info("üîÑ Refreshing RAG session to include newly processed file")

            if hasattr(self, 'rag_session') and self.rag_session:
                try:
                    # Get fresh stats to verify file was added
                    stats = self.rag_session.get_stats(timeout=2.0)
                    doc_count = stats.get('rag_pipeline', {}).get('documents_processed', 0)
                    logger.info(f"‚úÖ RAG session refreshed - now has {doc_count} documents")
                except Exception as stats_err:
                    logger.debug(f"Could not get RAG stats: {stats_err}")
            else:
                logger.debug("No RAG session to refresh")
        elif status == "failed":
            logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è File processing failed for {file_id[:8]}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Error in file processing completion handler: {e}")
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix:
```
User uploads file.txt
  ‚Üì
File processing starts (async)
  ‚Üì
RAG session created with FAISS state: 0 documents
  ‚Üì
File processing completes ‚Üí FAISS now has 1 document
  ‚Üì
User sends "what's in this file?"
  ‚Üì
RAG session queries its cached FAISS state: 0 documents ‚ùå
  ‚Üì
No context found!
  ‚Üì
Next message creates NEW session ‚Üí sees 1 document ‚úÖ
```

### After Fix:
```
User uploads file.txt
  ‚Üì
File processing starts (async)
  ‚Üì
RAG session created with FAISS state: 0 documents
  ‚Üì
File processing completes ‚Üí FAISS now has 1 document
  ‚Üì
üìÅ processing_completed signal fires
  ‚Üì
_on_file_processing_completed() handler called
  ‚Üì
üîÑ RAG session stats refreshed
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ RAG session now knows: 1 document available
  ‚Üì
User sends "what's in this file?"
  ‚Üì
RAG session queries FAISS: 1 document found ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Context included in response!
```

## Expected Behavior After Restart

When you upload a file and immediately send a message, you should see:

```
üìÅ File processing completed: abc12345 - completed
üîÑ Refreshing RAG session to include newly processed file
‚úÖ RAG session refreshed - now has 1 documents
```

Then your message will include context from the newly uploaded file.

## Testing Procedure

1. **Restart Ghostman** (required for fix to take effect)
2. **Create a new tab** or conversation
3. **Upload a text file** (e.g., notes.txt with some content)
4. **Immediately send a message** like "what's in this file?"
5. **Check the response** - it should include content from your file!

### Logs to Look For

**Success indicators:**
```
üìÅ File processing completed: <file_id> - completed
üîÑ Refreshing RAG session to include newly processed file
‚úÖ RAG session refreshed - now has 1 documents
```

**Then in the AI response:**
```
Querying SafeRAG pipeline with: 'what's in this file?...'
üß† Using SmartContextSelector for conversation: <id>
‚úÖ Conversation <id> has 1 files - proceeding with RAG query
üîç FAISS SEARCH: total vectors=<N>, search_k=<N>, top_k=3
[Context retrieved successfully]
```

## Additional Benefits

This fix also improves:
1. **File removal** - Removing files will trigger session refresh
2. **Multiple files** - Adding multiple files in succession will work correctly
3. **File browser consistency** - UI state stays in sync with RAG state

## Known Limitations

- The stats refresh is lightweight (just checks document count)
- Doesn't force full FAISS index reload (not needed - FAISS auto-updates)
- File processing must complete before message is sent (existing async behavior)

## Troubleshooting

### If context still doesn't appear:

1. **Check file processing completed:**
   ```
   grep "File processing completed" ghostman.log
   ```
   Should show "completed" status, not "failed"

2. **Check RAG session exists:**
   ```
   grep "RAG session refreshed" ghostman.log
   ```
   Should show the refresh happening

3. **Check file was actually added to FAISS:**
   ```
   grep "documents_processed" ghostman.log | tail -5
   ```
   Document count should increase after upload

### If processing_completed signal doesn't fire:

This could indicate a problem with file processing itself. Check for:
- File upload errors
- FAISS indexing errors
- Processing queue issues

**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING - Restart required

**Impact:** HIGH - Fixes major UX issue where uploaded files weren't usable until second message

**Risk:** LOW - Only adds signal handler, doesn't modify existing logic
